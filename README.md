## Notion Read JS
An unofficial API built with Express JS that allows using Notion as a headless CMS tool for your web projects.  

## Motivation
At the moment of writing this documentation, notion lacks an official public API that users can implement in their projects. As a notion user, I tend to write my notes and articles in this tool.  
However, if I want to share some of these articles with the world through my own blog, Notion does not provide me with an API that I can use in my Frontend Project.  
I want to take advantage of all the features and user experience that Notion provides, whilst integrating the content of my articles within my blog, having full control of the UI from my Frontend. And I want to be able to do that with a simple API call.

There are other open source unofficial Notion API projects that may serve this purpose and much more. But none of them are written in JS. Or I couldn't find one written in JS. Besides, they are too complex for what I want to achieve, which is just using Notion as a CMS for my Blog. Here are two popular ones that I found. [notion-py]([https://pypi.org/project/notion/](https://pypi.org/project/notion/)), written in *Python*; and [notionapi]([https://github.com/kjk/notionapi](https://github.com/kjk/notionapi)), written in *Go*.
